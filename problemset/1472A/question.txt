For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his 𝑛 friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size 𝑤×ℎ, which can be cut into pieces.

Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper 𝑤×ℎ that he has in only two cases:

If 𝑤 is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size 𝑤2×ℎ;
If ℎ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size 𝑤×ℎ2;
If 𝑤 and ℎ are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.

After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by 1.

Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size 𝑤×ℎ at into 𝑛 or more pieces, using only the rules described above.

Input
The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers 𝑤, ℎ, 𝑛 (1≤𝑤,ℎ≤104,1≤𝑛≤109) — the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.

Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:

"YES", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size 𝑤×ℎ into at least 𝑛 pieces;
"NO" otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).
